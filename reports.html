      <h3> <center>Below are a few of the reports I have written throughout my time in undergrad. In each of these I conducted all the data analysis using Python to clean, plot, and interpret the collected data. I would spend time conversing with collegues and mentors to determine the best courses of action for each project.</center> </h3>

                <h2>Bar Kinematics</h2>
                <p>Looked into differences in galaxies based on the kinematics of the bar structure inside. I made relations between the bulge prominence, spiral arm tightness and AGN                    rates based on the strength and speed of the bar. This report used alot of statistical analysis and study of distributions to find correlations. Results were                           coauthored into a paper focused on simulations of bar kinematics and is cited here (awaiting publication).

                <h2>Kinematic Mapping of H2O</h2>
                <p>Currently a work in progress, I am working with a retired UC Berkeley professor to look at the motion of Orion Src1, a protostar found in the Orion Nebula. By taking                   Position-Velocity cuts of the data I interpret the speed of H2O in the protostars disk and outflow which can then be used to determine the conservation of specific                     angular momentum in the star. This report works to apply to H2O which is then compared in velocity to other elements found in the cloud including NaCl, SiO, and SiS.

                <h2>Transit Method of Exoplanet GJ 1214b</h2>
                <p>This study delves into the determination of physical properties of exoplanets detected through the transit method. Focusing on GJ 1214b I employed observational data                   and light curve modeling to analyze its orbit, radius, and density.

                <h2>Keplarian Motion Parameters</h2>
                <p>In this laboratory report, we employ Laplace's method and Newtonian iteration to derive the six orbital parameters necessary for characterizing the orbit of an                         object in the solar system. The motion studied in the report is of comet 26 Proserpina where using 4 images taken of its motion in the night sky over the span of 2                     weeks the six orbital parameters are derived.

                <h2>Cephied Variables</h2>
                <p>This report focuses on finding the distance of the Andromeda galaxy using the same method as Edwin Hubble in 1924. By analyzing the pulsation period of a confirmed                     Cepheid variable in Andromeda, I am able to determine how far away the star is which as Hubble had shown, proves Andromeda is a separate galaxy from ours. This                         report focuses on the time series analysis of the collected data to get cleaner results
