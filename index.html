        <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto working towards my BSc in Astronomy and Physics. My courses cover topics in astronomy, cosmology, physics, computer science, and mathematics. My main interests lie in stellar evolution and the processes stars undergo to keep burning, as well as the timescales and scenarios in which stars' lives come to an end. Some upper level courses I have completed or am in the process of taking at the University are the following:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li> PHY357 - Nucelar and Particle Physics
          <li> PHY407 - Computational Physics
          <li> PHY408 - Time Series Analysis
          <li> PHY450 - Relativistic Electrodynamics
          <li> PHY483 - Relativity Theory 1
          <li> PHY484 - Relativity Theory 2
        </ol>
        
        
        <p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, and have spent my entire life living in the Greater Toronto Area. I have had many opportunities to travel to other countries, including places in Europe, Asia, and South America. Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by the night sky and the mysteries it holds. I thank my father for encouraging my curiosity as a kid as well as my mother for exposing me to as many sections of the STEM fields when I was little. I grew to like all the sections of science especially astronomy and chemistry and from there I made the decision that I want to be an astronomer. To this day while I am persuing astrophysics directly, all inclusions of mathematics, engineering, and chemistry intrigue me and feed into my passion for the topic.</p>
