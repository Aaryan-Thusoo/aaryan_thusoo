        <p>I recent graduate of the University of Toronto with a BSc. in Astronomy and Physics. My courses cover topics in astronomy, cosmology, physics, computer science, and mathematics. My main interests lie in stellar evolution and the processes stars undergo to keep burning, as well as the timescales and scenarios in which stars' lives come to an end. In my third year I recieved the Walter John Helm Scholarship In Astronomy And Astrophysics. This award is given to the student in their third year of study with the higehst GPA for a total of $2000. Some upper level courses I have completed or am in the process of taking at the University are the following:</p>

        <p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, and have spent my entire life living in the Greater Toronto Area. I have had many opportunities to travel to other countries, including places in Europe, Asia, and South America. Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by the night sky and the mysteries it holds. I thank my father for encouraging my curiosity as a kid as well as my mother for exposing me to as many sections of the STEM fields when I was little. I grew to like all the sections of science especially astronomy and chemistry and from there I made the decision that I want to be an astronomer. To this day while I am persuing astrophysics directly, all inclusions of mathematics, engineering, and chemistry intrigue me and feed into my passion for the topic.</p>
